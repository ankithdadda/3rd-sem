IF YOU ARE GONNA IMPROVE THE CODE 
ALWAYS DO IT IN THE TEMP BRANCH AND NOT THE MAIN BRANCH!!
AFTER REVIEWING THE CHANGES THEY WILL BE PUSHED TO THE MAIN BRANCH !!..
IF YOU HAVE A BETTER WAY OR A DIFFERENT WAY TO SOLVE THE QUESTIONS 
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO COMMITING YOUR FILE VIA PULL REQUESTS AND LABELING 'ENHANCEMENT'.
THERE'S ALWAYS A ROOM FOR DISCUSSIONS UNDER THE DISCUSSION TAB .

“ Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” – Cory House
